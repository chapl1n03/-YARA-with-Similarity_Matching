1: rule_1: 1 strings: s1

Command: yara tar_file_1 rule_1

Normal Yara workflow:
parser:
	convert tar_file_1 into FSM using Aho Corasick algorithm
lexer: 
	for each_string in [s1] in rule_1:
		each_rule string converted it to atoms a1...an
		for each_atom in a1...an 
			check if each_atom present within the FSM representation of tar_file_1
			if all n atoms match, then string s1 has an exact match with tar_file_1
				exact_string_match_count = 1
			else:
				exact_string_match_count = 0
		return exact_string_match_count
